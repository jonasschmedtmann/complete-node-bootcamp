# Contributing to Helmet

Helmet welcomes contributors! This guide should help you submit issues and pull requests.

## Got a question, problem, or feature request?

The documentation and [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/helmet.js) are good places to start.

Feel free to [add an issue](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet/issues) if those don't help!

## Want to submit a change?

If you're not sure whether your change will be welcomed, [add an issue](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet/issues) to ask.

Once you're ready to make your change, make a pull request. If you're having trouble making a pull request (it's tricky!), check out [GitHub's guide](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) or add an issue. We'll make it work!
