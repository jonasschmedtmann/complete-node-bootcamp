* Implement backtrace command.
* set host with --host
* use --local option to run script directly -
  a shortcut for starting the script with two commands:

    Instead of:

      $ node --debug-brk my_js.js &
      $ ndb

    The convenience --local is provided:

      ndb --local my_js.js

* wait for remote host to be up.  It'll spin in a loop and look for a connection every two
  seconds instead of bombing out immediately if it doesn't find one.
