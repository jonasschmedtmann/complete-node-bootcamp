All our knowledge has its origins in our perceptions.
Wisdom is the power to put our time and our knowledge to the proper use.
Before we acquire great power, we must acquire wisdom to use it well.
To acquire knowledge, one must study; but to acquire wisdom, one must observe.
Knowing is not enough; we must apply!I think people who are creative are the luckiest people on earth. I know that there are no shortcuts, but you must keep your faith in something Greater than you and keep doing what you love. Do what you love, and you will find the way to get it out to the world.The real problem is not whether machines think but whether men do.
On every thorn, delightful wisdom grows, in every rill a sweet instruction flows.
Friendship multiplies the good of life and divides the evil.
You can't shake hands with a clenched fist.
Belief consists in accepting the affirmations of the soul; Unbelief, in denying them.
