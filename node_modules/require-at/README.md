# require-at

Allow you to call `require` or `require.resolve` pretending that you are at another directory.

## Purpose

Given the directory structure below with two NodeJS apps:

    app1
    |-+ foo
    | +-- index.js
    | +--+ node_modules
    |    +--+ x 
    |       + ...
    app2
    |-+ bar
    | +-- index.js
    | +--+ node_modules
    |    +--+ y
    |       + ...

When you call `require("x")` in `/app1/foo/index.js`, NodeJS will search and find module `x` there.

Now from the same file, if you want to resolve the module `y` under the directory `/app2/bar`, you have to use an absolute or relative path directly pointing to `y`, and you may have to do some searching, probably re-implementing Node's module searching algorithm if you don't know exactly where `y` could be.

However, in the file `/app2/bar/index.js`, it can just do `require("y")` and Node would automatically find the module for it, because that file is at the location where `y` is under.

What if from the file `/app1/foo/index.js`, you can call `require` as if you were at the directory `/app2/bar`, then you would be able to utilize Node's module searching automatically. 

To achieve this, most other implementations choose to re-implement Node's module searching algorithm.

This module's approach is to tap into Node's `module` and let it do the work.

## Install

    $ npm install require-at --save

## Usage

A single function is exported.

##### `requireAt(dir, [request])`

-   If you call it with just `dir`, then it returns a `require` function that's been binded to the directory `dir`.  You can use it to load any module as if you are at `dir`.  
    -   You can also call `require.resolve` with the same effect.
-   If you call it with `dir` and a `request`, then it will load and return the module `request` as if at `dir`.

##### Example

```js
const requireAt = require("require-at");

// get back a require binded to /another/dir

const requireAtAnother = requireAt("/another/dir/");
const modXPath = requireAtAnother.resolve("modX");
const modX = requireAtAnother("modX");

// load modY at /another/yet/dir directly

const modY = requireAt("/another/yet/dir", "modY");
```
